      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to both the Rectly website (rectly.app) and the Rectly iOS app.
        We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and handle your personal data
        confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations as well as this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Privacy Policy for the Website (rectly.app)</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Data Controller</h3>
      <p>
        The data controller for data processing on this website is:<br>
        [Your Name/Company Name]<br>
        [Address]<br>
        [Email: contact@rectly.app]
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Collection and Storage of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit our website, information of a general nature is automatically collected.
        This information (server log files) includes the type of web browser, operating system used,
        the domain name of your internet service provider, and similar. This is exclusively information
        that does not allow any conclusions about your person.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        This website does not use tracking cookies. Only technically necessary cookies
        (e.g., for language selection) may be set. These serve exclusively the functionality
        of the website and do not collect any personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>1.4 SSL Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, this site
        uses SSL encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address
        line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://".
      </p>

      <h3>1.5 Contact</h3>
      <p>
        If you contact us by email, your information (email address, possibly name and other
        information provided) will be stored by us to answer your questions. We will not pass
        this data on to third parties without your consent. Processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. b GDPR.
      </p>

        transcripts, notes, and personal data are stored exclusively locally on your iOS device
        by default. We have no access to your data and it does not leave your device – unless
        you explicitly choose to use external services.

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Your API keys are stored encrypted in the iOS Keychain</li>
        <li>Access is via biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID)</li>
        <li>API keys never leave your device</li>
        <li>We as app developers have no access to your keys</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Permissions</h3>

        We do not collect usage data and do not create user profiles.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 Export and Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        You can export transcripts and recordings at any time via the iOS share function.
        You decide where the data is sent (email, cloud services, etc.).
        For these external services, their own privacy policies apply.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
