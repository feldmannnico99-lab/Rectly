      <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
        personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
        this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used
        to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for.
        It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by email)
        may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Notice Concerning the Responsible Party</h3>
      <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        Nico Feldmann<br>
        Klausenburger Gasse 8<br>
        51674 Wiehl
      </p>
      <p>
        Phone: +49 (0) 160 5720812<br>
        Email: nico@efeldmann.de
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines
        the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).
      </p>

      <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
      <p>
        Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data
        will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate
        request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we
        have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or commercial law
        retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.
      </p>

      <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6
        para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed pursuant
        to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries,
        data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to
        the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data
        processing is additionally carried out on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. The consent can be revoked
        at any time. If your data is required for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of
        pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore,
        we process your data if this is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6
        para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest
        pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are explained
        in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is
        also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to
        external parties if this is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so
        (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using data processors,
        we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid data processing agreement.
        In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
      </p>

      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent
        that has already been given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the
        revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
      <p>
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY
        TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR
        PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE
        RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
        IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR
        INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR
        DEFENCE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE
        RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE
        PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO
        SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER
        BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
        supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work,
        or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other
        administrative or judicial remedy.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
        fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
        If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it
        is technically feasible.
      </p>

      <h3>Information, Correction and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
        information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data
        processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this and other
        questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in
        the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we generally need time to verify this.
        For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing
        of your personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, you can request the restriction
        of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims,
        you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between
        your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have
        the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from its storage –
        only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defence of legal claims or for
        the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
        interest of the European Union or a Member State.
      </p>

      <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as orders or enquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognise an
        encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://"
        and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
      </p>
      <p>
        When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

      <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
      <p>
        The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files,
        which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is not merged with other data sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate
        interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimisation of their website – for this purpose,
        the server log files must be collected.
      </p>

      <h3>Enquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
      <p>
        If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your enquiry including all resulting personal data (name, enquiry)
        will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We will not pass on this data
        without your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your enquiry is related to the
        fulfilment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other
        cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of the enquiries
        addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this
        has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data sent to us via contact enquiries will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your
        consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been
        processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.
